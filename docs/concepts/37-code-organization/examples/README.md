# Code Organization Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating code organization patterns in Next.js.

## Examples

### 1. Folder Structure (`01-folder-structure.md`)
Demonstrates folder structure:
- App Router structure
- Component organization
- Feature-based structure

### 2. Barrel Exports (`02-barrel-exports.ts`)
Shows barrel export patterns:
- Component exports
- Utility exports
- Type exports

### 3. Feature Structure (`03-feature-structure.md`)
Demonstrates feature-based organization:
- Feature modules
- Co-location
- Shared components

## How to Use

1. **Review examples**: Understand different patterns
2. **Choose structure**: Pick what fits your project
3. **Apply patterns**: Implement in your project
4. **Maintain consistency**: Keep structure consistent

## Key Concepts

### Folder Structure
- App Router conventions
- Logical organization
- Scalable structure

### Barrel Exports
- Simplified imports
- Cleaner code
- Better DX

### Feature Organization
- Feature modules
- Co-location
- Separation of concerns

## Best Practices

1. **Follow conventions**: App Router structure
2. **Co-locate files**: Keep related code together
3. **Use barrel exports**: Simplify imports
4. **Be consistent**: Maintain structure
5. **Document structure**: README files

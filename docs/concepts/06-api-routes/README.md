## Overview

API Routes allow you to create API endpoints as part of your Next.js application. They can be created in both the App Router (Route Handlers) and Pages Router.

## Key Topics

- Route Handlers (App Router) - Using `route.ts` files
- API Routes (Pages Router) - Using `pages/api/` directory
- HTTP Methods - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- Request/Response Handling - Parsing requests and sending responses
- Edge Runtime - Running on the Edge network
